# Bloxd Pack Porter (Open-Source)

## Purpose
• This Porter ports Textures of a Minecraft Bedrock RP to work natively on Bloxd.

• You Download the Latest Release, Run the batch and make sure to include whitelist.txt alongside it for it to work!

## What's a Whitelist?
• Whitelist decides which texture is whether ported or not, it contains all the arguments defining names to change.

• You can make work of whitelist.txt so to add more entries that will get converted to Bloxd.io!

•  An Example would be "netherite_sword.png=knight_sword.png" where the first element [e.g. netherite_sword.png] is the source and the second element [e.g. knight_sword.png] is the output

• ".png" extension is required in order for the program to work.
